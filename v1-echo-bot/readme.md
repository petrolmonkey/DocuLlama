## Summary
I discovered I could use Python, a language I am familiar with, to create the front end with its Streamlit library. This part was about getting familiar with the library's methods; I learned how to accept user input, generate a pre-defined response and display it. Below is a screenshot of the chatbot created using the Streamlit tutorial. It showed me how to leverage the tools that are available so I can focus on tasks that have more value.
