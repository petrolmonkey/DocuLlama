A chatbot for looking up information in owner's manuals

## Source
My folder of owner's manuals

## Objective
Since I have a lot of tools and I am somewhat organized and have OCD, I have collected many owner's manuals over the years. It's not just tools either; there are manuals for appliances and other stuff I have accumulated over the years.

Inevitably, something breaks -- like the lawnmower not starting -- and then I have to fix it. Sometimes I want to make something I don't normally make, like sticky rice. My Japanese rice cooker is intimidating and I don't want to mess up since I hate soggy rice.

The purpose of this chatbot is to provide a way to get the information I want easily.
