# Chatbot
A chatbot for looking up information in owner's manuals

## Objective
Since I like to work with my hands, I have collected a lot of tools and manuals over the years. Inevitably, something breaks - like the lawnmower not starting - and then I have to find the manual and sift through the pages to find what I need; it can be a chore.

One way to make this process streamlined, is to download all the manuals and use a chatbot to locate the information. I needed a chatbot interface but I had no experience designing in HTML or CSS. It was daunting. So I decided to break it down into chunks.
