# chatbot
A chatbot for looking up information in owner's manuals

## Objective
Since I have a lot of tools and I am somewhat organized and have OCD, I have collected many owner's manuals over the years. There are manuals for tools, appliances and other stuff I accumulated over the years. Inevitably, something breaks - like the lawnmower not starting - and then I have to fix it, or sometimes I want to make something I don't normally make, like sticky rice. It can be a chore to find the manual and then sift through the pages to find what I want to know. This chatbot was made to provide a way to get the information easily.

## Version Overview
### chatbot v1

### chatbot v2
This version converts 10 instruction manuals into a searchable data structure and makes it accessible through the chatbot interface.
