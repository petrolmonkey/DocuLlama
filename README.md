# Introduction
Since I like to work with my hands, I have collected a lot of tools and manuals over the years. Inevitably, something breaks - like the lawnmower not starting - and then I have to find the manual and sift through the pages to find what I need; it can be a chore.

One way to streamline the process was to use a Large Language Model (LLM) to locate the information. To do this, I needed a chatbot interface but I had no experience designing in HTML or CSS. It was daunting. So I decided to break it down into chunks.
