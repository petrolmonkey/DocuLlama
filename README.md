# chatbot
A chatbot for looking up information in owner's manuals

## Objective
Since I have a lot of tools and I am somewhat organized and have OCD, I have collected many owner's manuals over the years. There are manuals for tools, appliances and other stuff I accumulated over the years. Inevitably, something breaks - like the lawnmower not starting - and then I have to fix it, or sometimes I want to make something I don't normally make, like sticky rice. It can be a chore to find the manual and then sift through the pages to find what I want to know. This chatbot was made to provide a way to get the information easily.

### chatbot v1
[chatbot v1](./v1-echo-bot)
This folder shows the building blocks I needed to achieve my objective. When I started this project, I had no experience designing in HTML or CSS. It was a bit daunting. Then I discovered I could use Streamlit to create the front end using Python, a language I am familiar with. I learned how to accept user input, generate a pre-defined response and display it using Streamlit's library. 

### chatbot v2
The first 2 examples.... how to obtain and load an API key to use an LLM.

### chatbot v3
[chatbot v3](./v3-doc-qa)
This version converts several instruction manuals into a searchable data structure and makes it accessible through the chatbot interface. The predefined responses in the script were replaced with a query engine.
